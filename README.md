# LPBF_CUDA
CUDA-accelerated finite difference solver for transient heat conduction in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Models moving laser heat input, phase change, and boundary effects with high spatial-temporal resolution. Built for parameter studies, thermal field prediction on GPU and creating datasets for training neural operator surrogates.
