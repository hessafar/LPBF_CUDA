# CUDAM
CUDA-accelerated finite difference solver for Additive Manufacturing applications, i.e. transient heat conduction in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. It models moving laser heat source, phase change, and boundary effects with high spatial-temporal resolution. Built for parameter studies, thermal field prediction on GPU and creating datasets for training neural operator surrogates.
